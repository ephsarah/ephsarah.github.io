# Sarah Yang
## Williams College 2020, Comparative Literature

I have very little sewing experience. (I think I practiced a bit in Girl Scouts, but 4th grade feels like a long time ago!)

I have no programming experience. Excited to learn! And, in general, I'm excited to get a better understanding of what software engineers do.

1 boring fact about me: I bought a plant at Stop & Shop last week. She goes by Glinda.
