# Assignment: Sweater Weather

* Wrote a program in C to practice using if/else if/else statements (conditionals).
* The integer variable is temperature and can be set to any integer value.
* Depending on the temperature input, the program outputs an appropriate dress code for that weather.

Tip for my past self: "else" is a catch all by nature, so you don't have to have a (body) that defines what it is.
