# Assignment: Circuit Plushy

The assignment was to make a light up plushy using felt, 3 LED lights, battery + holder, slide switch, button, conductive and non-conductive thread. Below I've broken down the steps with pictures.

1. Began by paper prototyping the plushy, tracing how the battery connects to the slide switch, LEDs, and button.

2. Tested the design using alligator wires.

3. Connected the electronic components via conductive thread in running stitch. Sewed the edges of the plushy using regular thread in whip stitch. The LEDs light up when the slide switch (maintained switch) is slid to the "ON" position and the button (momentary switch) is pressed.

Tip for my past self: When sewing the conductive thread, leave enough of a margin to do the whip stitch - otherwise things get cramped.
