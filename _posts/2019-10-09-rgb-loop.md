# Assignment: RGB Loop

* This program uses a loop to imitate turning on different colored LEDs.
* Every 10th time through the loop, the program prints RED, GREEN, or BLUE, and it prints each of these 3 times.
* The variable runTimes controls how many times through the loop runs.

Tip for my past self: It was helpful to define another variable (color) to control the switching of the colors printed (ie. "color = color + 1")
