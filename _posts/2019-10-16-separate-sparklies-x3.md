# Assignment: Separate Sparklies x3

* This was a 3 part assignment in which we programmed 3 sets of the ProtoSnap LEDs to mimic the flash patterns of the fireflies of the Great Smoky Mountains.
* Each set of LEDs lit up according to a different pattern

Flashbulb: Pin A5 flashes brightly for 0.5 seconds, every 4 seconds, starting at 0 seconds.

![Synchronous](https://ephsarah.github.io/img/sync6.JPG)

Synchronous: Pin 6 flashes 0.2s in a series of 3 flashes with 0.1s break between each, every 10s.

Big Dipper: A7 flashes every 3 seconds, glow increases by 30 every 0.1 s.



Tip: the Arduino SparkFun examples are very helpful starting points! Add in-line comments to remember why you did each part.
