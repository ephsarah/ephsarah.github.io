# Assignment: Odd Menu

* There were 2 variables invovled: numberChoice and mealOption.
* An odd numberChoice denotes the secret menu, an even numberChoice denotes the regular menu.
* Each menu consists of 3 meal options (1, 2, 3). If the customer inputs something other than 1, 2, or 3, the program tells them they chose an invalid option and have to choose between 1, 2, or 3.

Tip for my past self: Remember that "=" defines a variable, while "==" is the relational operator (i.e. "==" goes in the body of an if statement!).
