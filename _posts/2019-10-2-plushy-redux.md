# Assignment: Plushy Redux

* This is a program version of the plushy sewing assignment.
* Depending on the button and switch positions (off/on), the LEDs will either light up or not.
* Depending on the behavior of the LEDs, the program will print "off" or "on" three times.
* The only condition which results in 3 lit up LEDs is when the button AND switch are on.

Tip for my past self: Define the behavior of the LEDs below the "if" statement that describes the positions of the button and switch. Then, use a nested if to tell the program what to print!
