# Assignment: Homemade Switches

* The assignment was to light up at least 1 LED on our embroidery sampler.
* The circuit included a battery, a conductive-fabric-switch, and a conductive-thread-patches switch.
* I tried to make an ice cream cone with the already sewed portion of my sampler as the cone, the 2 LEDs and stars as sprinkles, and the ice cream outlined in the green thread. (Pistachio or matcha flavored!)
* NOTE: I accidently sewed my LEDs on backwards!

Tip for my past self: Be careful about the way I sew on the LEDs!
