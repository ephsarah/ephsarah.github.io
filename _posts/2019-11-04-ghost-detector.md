# Assignment: Ghost Detector

* The program lights up all red LEDs when it is cold and dark enough for ghosts to be present
* i.e. when the temperature and light sensor sense values that are below certain thresholds.

Tip for my past self: differentiate between the value I'm storing as a threshold (coldTemp, darkLight), and the actual values (tempVoltage, lightValue).
