# Assignment: Jammin'

* The program plays "Jingle Bells" when the slide switch is turned on
* Music code taken from http://repairmypc.net/2017/08/jingle-bells-arduino-sketch/

Tip for my past self: figuring out how to attach the slide switch and incorporate this into the code was a little complicated. Had it analogRead in from the switch in order to make it dependent on the switch position. Also had to make sure that the 'on' side of the switch was connected to A9, and 'off' to the - ground.
