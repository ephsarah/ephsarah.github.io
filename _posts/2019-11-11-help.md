# Assignment: Help, I Need Somebody!

* The program emits Morse code "SOS" to the Vibe Board when circuit is closed
* Emits Morse code "Sarah" when circuit open
* Closed circuit = switch ON, open circuit = switch OFF

Tip for my past self: in the loop, remember to store the voltage from the switch pin as "int s" (for example). Then go into the if/else statements.
