# Assignment: Project Report

1. **Project title, description, motivation**

    ## Sarah's Singing LED Christmas Tree.
    
    *Amidst the stress of papers and final exams, it's often hard for me to get in the Christmas spirit!*
    *I designed this singing, light-up Christmas tree to remind myself that the most wonderful time of the year is indeed right around the corner...no matter the academic challenges that lie ahead.*
    *It's the perfect size to hang up on your dorm wall - and small enough to bring home to show off to parents! I know mine are anxious to see the new skills I've picked up in CS103.*
    * * When light sensor senses it's dark, LEDs flash in pattern that looks like snow falling (highest position LED to lowest -- white, green, red -- twinkling similar to ghost firefly).*
    * * When light sensor senses it's dark AND yellow star is snapped onto top of tree, buzzer plays "Jingle Bells" and LEDs flash according to the music.*

2. **Comprehensive materials list**
    *LilyPad board
    *6 LilyPad LEDs
    *1 light sensor
    *1 buzzer
    *conductive thread
    *12" strip of conductive fabric
    *scissors, needle
    *1 snap (1 female and 1 male side)
    *green felt (20" x 20")
    *1 square brown felt
    *1 square yellow felt
    *red, green shiny embroidery floss
    *yellow, green embroidery floss

4. **1 Photo of your alligator prototype working**


5. **Photo of at least 3 stages of your working project (or video)**


6. **3 tips to your past self**
    1. Digital vs. Analog Reads! I've made this mix-up a couple times now...In this case, I was accidentally analogReading the snap!
    2. Be brave and test, test, test! There were several moments when I felt wary of moving forward with the project because I was worried it wouldn't work and then I'd have to start over. I realized that sometimes you have to just go for it -- test when you can, but sometimes you just have to hope for the best and see if it works!
    3. Overestimate time it takes to sew decorations! This is not something that can be rushed...Rushing == painful needle pokes!
