## A bit about me & why I'm here!

Senior year! With just 8 classes left, it sounded to me like the right time to face the subject I had been **intrigued** by, but perhaps **avoiding**. Computer science was that subject. I'm **intrigued** for many reasons.
1. I want a peak into the behind-the-scenes of this digital age we're living in...what do coders *do*?

2. In past summer internships, I've been involved in the tech world in non-technical roles. I've had to message the value of an app, but admittedly knew very little about what the engineers did to build it.

3. I like working with my hands (cooking, knitting, petting dogs, etc.) which is why I'm excited to sew!

I've been **avoidant** because I spend more time reading and writing about books as a comp lit major, and I feared comp sci probably wouldn't be my thing. On the other hand, taking classes from a variety of disciplines has been one of my favorite things about Williams.

All in all, I'm excited to be here and to learn some new skills that will hopefully enhance my understanding of the world going on around me and the technology - wearable and not - I interact with everyday.
