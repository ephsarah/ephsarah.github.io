## Who I am & why I'm here!

Senior year! With just 8 classes left, it sounded to me like the right time to jump off the deep end and face the subjects I had been **intrigued** by, but also consciously **avoiding**. Computer science was that subject. **Intrigued** for many reasons.
1. I want a peak into the behind-the-scenes of this digital age we're living in...what do coders *do*?
2. Through work/internships, I've been involved in the tech world in non-technical roles. I've had to message the value of an app, but admittedly didn't learn what the engineers did to build it.
3. I like working with my hands (cooking, knitting, petting dogs, etc) which is why I'm excited to get my sewing on!
**Avoidant** because I spend more time reading and writing about books as a comp lit major, so I feared comp sci probably wouldn't be my thing.
Anyhoo, I'm excited to be here and to learn some new skills that will hopefully enhance my understanding of the world going on around me and the technology - wearable and not - I interact with everyday.
